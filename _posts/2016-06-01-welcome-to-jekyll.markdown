Overview
Good for testing diverse groups of people
Requires minimal preparation
Quick to conduct
Less thorough examination of user behavior
Unable to record audio/video of testing

Pros
Requires minimal preparation and takes about two hours to conduct
There is less pressure on us because we don’t have to schedule a specific day or time to test
Can feel more natural for participants because they don’t need to travel and there are no cameras
We can select who we test with which results in a diverse group of participants

Cons
Unable to record audio or video of the testing
Conditions can be tough if you are outside or the weather turns out bad
Some people might decline to participate



Preparation

Create Questions
The first thing we need to do is form 3-5 questions based on what we hope to learn from the usability test

Questions should not be too leading

Questions can be open ended or based on range

Resources: Example Question Sheet

Create Scenario
We need to create a scenario for the user to put themselves into when testing our product. The scenario should be easy to understand and feel familiar to someone who would be purchasing tickets to a live event.

Example Scenario

“You’re a big fan of the signer Adele. You heard that she will be performing later this summer in North Carolina and tickets just went on sale.”

We need to give the participant a task to complete. The task should be simple for the user to understand and help us answer questions about the experience we are testing.

Example Task

“Open the ticketmaster app and purchase the two best tickets to Adele at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex.”

Choose a location
We need to pick a location to conduct this test. A good location will have enough people around that it won’t be hard to find participants.

It should also not have have too many other people trying to get user’s attention. For example, a mall food court might not be a good location because of all the vendors trying to solicit their food.

The location should have enough space so that you and the participants are comfortable. Try and avoid cramped spaces like hallways.  

Choose a Reward
We want to give participants a reward for assisting us in our testing. For light usability testing we usually give participants $5 Starbucks gift cards.

The reward you choose should be pretty generic so it will be appealing to most people.



Introduction

When approaching people make sure you approach them from the front and make eye contact.

Introduce yourself like you would introduce yourself to someone you are meeting for the first time at a party.

It’s really important to let the user know we are testing the product and not them, the tester can’t do anything wrong and we really want their honest feedback.

This introduction is really important because it set’s the tone for the test and clearly states to the tester what their role is.


NDA
Before conducting the test we need to have participants sign an NDA (Non Disclosure Agreement) which states that the information exchanged between Ticketmaster and the tester will remain between those two parties.

DO NOT proceed with the test until the participant has signed the NDA. If the participant does not sign the NDA we cannot proceed with the test.

Resources: LiveNation Entertainment NDA

Explain Scenario
After the user signs the NDA and before we hand them the phone explain the scenario they are in. This will help the participants understand their motivations for using the product and what they are trying to accomplish.

Example Scenario

“You’re a big fan of the signer Adele. You heard that she will be performing later this summer in North Carolina and tickets just went on sale.”

Explain Tasks
After explaining the scenario we need to give the participant a task to complete. The task should be simple for the user to understand and help us answer questions about the experience we are testing.

Once the participant understands the task hand them the phone and ask them to complete the task.

Example Task

“Open the ticketmaster app and purchase the two best tickets to Adele at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex.”

Observe User Behaviour
While the participant is completing the task it’s important that we pay close attention to what they are doing and how they are reacting to their experience.  

If the participant talks about their experience ask them questions about the statements they are making.




Ask Questions
When the participant has completed the task hand them the questions sheet you created and ask them to complete it.

Let the participant know that they can elaborate on any of the questions if they wish and that it would be helpful to us.

Complete Test
When the participant has completed the question sheet and you are done talking, give them their reward and thank them for helping out with the test. Let them know that their involvement is greatly appreciated and was a big help to us.
